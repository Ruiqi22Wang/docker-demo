# docker-demo

This is a demo for the usage of docker container and the deployment of a .py file. In the .py file, a neural network for classification is built. 

The model is contructed by PyTorch, trained and validated on the iris dataset from scikit learn. (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).
